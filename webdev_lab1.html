			<p>Hello, My name is Mark Fedechko, welcome to my page! </p>
			<p>I am majoring in ITM and am currently a 4th year. I had switched majors in the past a few times.</p>
			<p>Fun fact about me, this past summer, I biked across America on a road bike while also raising money and awareness for individuals with disabilities. I bike from Seattle to Whashington D.C. in the span of 67 days and while covering 4450 miles. If you wish to find out more, you can look online for the "journey of hope"</p>
